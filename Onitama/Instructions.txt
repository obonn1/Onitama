The two cards on your side are the ones you own, they show possible movements.
To take your turn select a card, then select a piece and move the piece.

The dark pieces are masters
All pieces can eat pieces of the opposite color

The square that your master starts in is your temple


To WIN the game either:
-Defeat the opposing master
-Have your master enter the opposing temple


When you use a card to move, it'll switch with the neutral card in the center, so pay attention to what card you'll be getting
and which one's you're handing to your opponent

Each new game has 5 random cards out of 16, you keep the same 5 cards throughout the game
