# Onitama

### Project Goal

This project is a digitization of the board game by the same name. It is meant to serve both as a training
exercise for the production process and a showcase of my abilities as a beginner developer. When I began the
project towards the end of September I had been learning to code for a little more than two months.

Special thanks go to [Joseph Musser](https://github.com/jnm2) for his mentorship and for introducing me to programming.

### What is Onitama

Onitama is an award winning strategy game designed by Shimpei Sato and published in America by Arcane Wonders.
The two-player game is played on a 5x5 grid, with each player owning five pieces - four students and one master.
The players take turns moving their pieces in order to capture enemy pieces. The objective is to either:

A: Capture the enemy master.

or

B: Place your master in the enemy's temple (the starting place of their master.)

The possible movements available to the pieces are dictated by cards. Five of these cards are drawn at the beginning
of the game. Each player receives two and one remains in a neutral position. Any time a card is used for movement,
it's switched with the neutral card. Players would be wise to consider which cards they will be receiving for next
turn, along with which card they're giving up for their opponent to receive.

An explanation of these rules is shown when the program first opens and can be accessed through the menu button.
